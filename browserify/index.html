<h1>Browserify</h1>
<p>Precompiles many Javascript files into one in a form suitable to run in a browser, using the CommonJS specification.</p>
<p>Each Javascript file can require and export another with a syntax similar to that of Node.js, which also implements the CommonJS specification.</p>
<p>The search path of Browserify's `require` is the same as that of `npm`, which means that with it `npm` can be used to distribute Javascript code. There are modules which can be used for both Node and in the browser.</p>
<p>Written in Node.js.</p>
<p>Demo: should not show <code>FAIL</code>:</p>
<script src="bundle.js"></script>
