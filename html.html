  #link

    The link element links to different types of external documents.

    The `rel` attribute specifies what is the type.

    One notable exception of external document that is not referred to via
    link ref are scripts such as javascript, which must be referred to with
    script href [for some reason](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2631635/can-i-load-javascript-code-using-link-tag).

    <!--
    #style

      Links to external stylesheet files such as CSS.

    #shortcut icon ##favicon

      The image will show on most browsers on the tab before the title.

      It is like an icon of a desktop application.

      A standard name for the icon image is `favicon.ico`.

<p>Main HTML cheat.</p>
<p>
  Information is about HTML5 by default, unless stated otherwise.
  Backwards compatibility will also be considered.
</p>
<p>Considers both W3C standards and general browser support levels.</p>

<ul data-toc></ul>

<h2>#Standards</h2>

  <p>
    HTML is standardized by the Word Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
    <a href="http://www.w3.com">http://www.w3.com</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> website is not affiliated in any way to W3C.
    It is said that it contains many errors, and its certification is worthless: it is the cplusplus.com of the web.
  </p>

  <h3>#HTML5</h3>

    <p>
      WD of 2008, expected REC for 2014: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML5 standard</a>
      The huge time lapse is in part due to wars on the future of Flash replacement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all HTML5 is not XML, just pretty close to it.
      It is however possible to write HTML5 code that is valid XML.
      XHTML5 is a version of HTML5 which is always XML.
    </p>
    <p>HTML5 is not SGML, but it was influenced by it. HTML 4 is SGML.</p>

  <h3>#XHTML5</h3>

    <p>XHTML5 is a strictly XML version of HTML5.</p>
    <p>The standard is developed together with HTML5.</p>
    <p>
      Browsers differentiate between the two based on the HTTP content type:
      <code>text/html</code> is for HTML5 and <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> is for XHTML5.
      The <code>DOCTYPE</code> is not used to differentiate between HTML and XHTML.
    </p>

    <h4>XHTML5 vs HTML5</h4>

      <p>The distinction is made by the MIME type on the `content-type` field of the HTTP header:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>XHTML uses `application/xhtml+xml`</li>
        <li>HTML  uses `text/html`</li>
      </ul>
      <p>TODO what about DOCTYPE?</p>
      <p>There are important syntax differences between HTML and XHTML, specially concerning end tags</p>

      <h5>CDATA</h5>

        <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7092236/what-is-cdata-in-html">SO thread</a></p>
        <p><code>CDATA</code> is not treated specially in HTML5.</p>
        <p>
          It's main use in XHTML to allow characters like &amp;
          to be written in <code>script</code> elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          However in HTML5 this is not necessary, as opening script tags make the parser ignore everything
          up to the closing tag.
        </p>
        <p>
          To write code that is portable to both HTML5 and XHTLM5,
          a common technique is to write the CDATA inside script on commented out lines.
        </p>

  <h3>#validation</h3>

    <p>W3C offers an HTML validation service at: http://validator.w3.org/</p>
    <p>You can either upload your file, or give it an URL.</p>
    <p>
      There are also tools that make it faster to validate a page,
      for example the Firefox Web Developer extension.
    </p>

<h2>#style</h2>

  <p>Google style guide: http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/htmlcssguide.xml

  <h3>#My style</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Indent with 2 spaces.</li>
      <li>Indent at headers. Hugely increases readability.</li>
      <li>Indent at every flow-content element.</li>
      <li>
        Make the document as XHTML5 as possible, that is:
        <ul>
          <li>close all optional closing tags</li>
          <li>add the dummy slash to void elements</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

<h2>#debugging</h2>

  <p>In order to understand what is going on, you will want to use browser tools.</p>

  <h3>#Firefox</h3>

    <p>Firefox has the built-in Web developers tool which is quite good. Shortcut: Ctrl + I.</p>
    <p>
      It also has the popular third party #Bugzilla tool. Bugzilla was more popular in the past when the built-in tool was worse,
      now using just the built-in tool should be enough
    </p>
    <p>
      To validate HTML easily, try: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/
      Shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + L
    </p>

<h2>#syntax</h2>

  <p>http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html</p>

  <h3>#element vs #tag #start tag #end tag</h3>

    <p>`&lt;p&gt;a&lt;/p&gt;` is an element</p>
    <p>
      `&lt;p&gt;` and `&lt;/p&gt;` are a start and end tag respectively.
      The standard does not mention the terms "opening" or "closing" tags, so don't use them.
    </p>

    <h4>#Tag case</h4>

      <p>All tag names are case insensitive.</p>
      <p>
        Lower case names are much more common now. They are easier to type,
        and tags + syntax highlighting already gives them enough visibility.
      </p>

  <p>XHTML5 is simple, just like XML:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>all tags can be self-closed, e.g: <code>&lt;br&gt;</code></li>
    <li>all tags must be closed somehow (self or not).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In HTML5, things are much messier. There are five different kinds of elements
    to consider, and tons of rules.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      #Void elements: area, base, br, col, embed, hr, img, input, keygen, link,
      meta, param, source, track, wbr.
    </li>
    <li>#Raw text elements: script, style</li>
    <li>#Escapable raw text: textarea, title</li>
    <li>#Foreign elements: MathML and SVG.</li>
    <li>#Normal: the rest, including p, u, li, div</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>#void element closing tag</h3>

    <p>void elements are the only elements which *cannot* have an end tag.</p>
    <p>As a consequence, they cannot have any content, which justifies their name.</p>

  <h3>#self closing slash</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        HTML5: only void and foreign elements may have a self closing slash.
        <ul>
          <li>void elements: `&lt;br /&gt;` == `&lt;br&gt;`: the slash is omitted
          <li>foreign elements: same as XHTML
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In XHTML, `&lt;p /&gt;` == `&lt;p /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;`</li>
      <li>
        HTML4: `&lt;p /&gt;` == `&lt;p&gt;&gt;`. The slash can appear on any element,
        and it is the same as the greater than sign.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>#optional tags #omit tags</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        start and end tags for some elements can be omitted: http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#syntax-tag-omission
        There is no simple rule, only a huge list of rules. Some interesting points include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            html, body and head *start and end* tags can be omitted!
          </li>
          <li>
            p elements has by far the most complex rule. Quoting:
            p element's end tag may be omitted if the p element is immediately followed by an
            address, article, aside, blockquote, div, dl, fieldset, footer, form, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, header, hgroup, hr, main, nav, ol, p, pre, section, table, or ul, element,
            or if there is no more content in the parent element and the parent element is not an a element.
          </li>
          <li>
            li element's end tag may be omitted if the li element is immediately followed by another li element
            or if there is no more content in the parent element.
          </li>
          <li>
            div, ul, table and blockquote tags must have and end tag
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Foreign elements can be self closing, but the meaningless slash is not meaningless.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>#minimal valid HTML5</h3>

    <p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9797046/whats-a-valid-html5-document</p>
    <p>Contained in: `min.html`.</p>
    <p>Such minimalism may break on IE8 as noted in the SO thread.</p>
    <p>A saner and more portable minimal template is `html2.html`.</p>

<h2>#protocol relative URL #URL without protocol</h2>

  <p>E.g.: `//google.com` instead of `http://google.com`.</p>
  <p>Browser uses the same protocol as the current one.</p>
  <p>Useful to be dry when using HTTPS vs HTTP for resources that can be retrieved in both forms.</p>
  <p>CDNs often offer CSS and Javascript in protocol relative URLs.</p>
  <p>Specified in RFC 3986, with the rest of the URI specs: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.2 </p>
  <p>
    Drawback: if you open your files with the `file://` protocol, it will also use the `file` protocol and fail.
    Workaround: use  a web server on `http://localhost`.
  </p>
  <p>Well implemented on modern browsers.</p>

<h2>#doctype</h2>

  <p>The first line determines the document type.</p>
  <p>HTML5 has one single possibility: `&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;`. It is case insensitive.</p>
  <p>HTML4 has multiple possibilities</p>
  <p>XHTML5 has only accepts uppercase, so just stick to the uppercase version.</p>

<h2>#html element</h2>

  <p>Can be omitted: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5641997/is-it-necessary-to-write-head-body-and-html-tags</p>

<h2>#head</h2>

  <p>Contains document metadata.</p>
  <p>
    Can be omitted: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5641997/is-it-necessary-to-write-head-body-and-html-tags
    TODO how toes HTML decide what is inside of it and what is inside the body? Can all head tags only be inside it?
  </p>

  <h3>#title</h3>

    <p>Required.</p>
    <p>On all modern browsers, appears on the tab name.</p>
    <p>Has big importance to search engines.</p>

  <h3>#meta</h3>

    <p>As you may guess, contain document metadata.</p>
    <p>
      Besides a few standard <code>name</code> arguments, HTML5 says that anyone
      can recommend a new <code>name</code> usage:
      <a href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions">http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions</a>.
      For instance, Rails defines <code>csrf-param</code> and <code>csrf-token</code> there.
    </p>

    <h4>#charset</h4>

      <p>Indicates the document's encoding.</p>
      <p>Very important document wide, so it must be within the first 512 bytes of the document.</p>
      <p>Keep your sanity and use UTF-8 *everywhere*.</p>
      <p>
        There seems to be no requirement at all that certain glyphs are available to user agents or not:
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2702447/which-of-the-following-unicode-characters-should-be-used-in-html">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2702447/which-of-the-following-unicode-characters-should-be-used-in-html</a>
      </p>
      <p>The only official recommendation we could find seems very vague: http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/charset.html#h-5.4</p>

    <h4>#http-equiv</h4>

      <p>Set values of things that can be set on the HTTP headers.</p>

      <p>
        Only a few values a supported:
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/document-metadata.html#attr-meta-http-equiv">http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/document-metadata.html#attr-meta-http-equiv</a>
      </p>

      <p><code>Content-Language</code> is deprecated in favor of the global <code>lang</code> attribute.</p>

      <h5>#refresh</h5>

        <p>Automatically refresh page after 1 second or redirect to another page!</p>
        <p>This is a non standard HTTP header that is standard on HTML.</p>
        <p>
          Interesting way to automatically reload news feeds without Javascript,
          reload modifications on this cheat, or just annoy your users to hell.
        </p>
        <p>Too annoying even for tests!</p>
        <p>Redirect instead of refresh. Evil idea: HTML-only infinite loop of redirects!</p>

<h2>#body</h2>

  <p>Contains document "visible" content.</p>
  <p>Can be omitted: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5641997/is-it-necessary-to-write-head-body-and-html-tags</p>

  <h3>#lang attribute</h3>

    <p>
      It is recommended that you always set the `lang` attribute of the `html`
      tag to help search engines.
    </p>
    <p>
      In HTML5, can be used on any tag an sets the language of the element,
      but the most common place to put it by far is in the body element.
    </p>
    <p>`meta http-equiv="Content-Language"` is deprecated.</p>

<h2>#References #Character references #Entities </h2>

  <p>HTML5 uses only the term "references": http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#syntax-references</p>
  <p>There are two kinds of entities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>named. E.g.:   &amp;gt;   &gt;</li>
    <li>numeric: Refer to Unicode code points. Start with the number sign `#`.
      <ul>
        <li>decimal:   &amp;#60;  &#60;</li>
        <li>hex:       &amp;#x3C; &#x3C;</li>
        <li>TODO: possible to use Unicode can be achieved directly like &amp;#4E2D;?</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>HTML5 adopts exactly the same references as XML, but earlier versions do not, so watch out.</p>
  <p>Notably: &quot; is on the official list of valid HTML 4 entities, but &apos; is not.</p>
  <p>Entities are considered in both data and attribute values.</p>
  <p>Escape sequences intended for characters that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have an specific meaning to HTML. Important ones:
      <ul>
        <li>greater than &amp;gt;  &gt;  Used in tags.</li>
        <li>less than    &amp;lt;  &lt;  Used in tags.</li>
        <li>ampersand    &amp;amp; &amp; Used in escape entities themselves.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Not present in the current encoding, such as Unicode character in an ASCII encoded file.</p>
      <p>Prefer Unicode for all non-whitespace characters.</p>
      <p>Useful whitespace characters:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>non-breaking whitespace #nbsp; &nbsp; Whitespace at which lines cannot reflow.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>#nbsp example. Before&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After</p>

<h2>#attributes</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1735230/can-i-add-custom-attribute-to-html-tag">Using non standard tags makes your document invalid</a>.
    It is still likely to render correctly on all browsers.
    You can also cheat this by referencing a custom !DOCTYPE declaration, but this is really overkill.
    HTML allows you to use any attribute prefixed by `data-`. Great addition!
  </p>

  <p>
    Each element can have a specific set of attributes:
    these are specified on HTML5 on the documentation of each element under the
    "Content attributes" section.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are attributes which can be used for every element: those are called
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#global-attributes">Global attributes</a>
  </p>

  <h2>#quoting and escaping in attributes</h2>

    <p>Double or single quotes are both OK, the only difference is what must be escaped:</p>
    <div data-val="attr"></div>
    <div data-val='attr'></div>
    <div data-val='"'></div>
    <div data-val="&quot;"></div>
    <div data-val="'"></div>
    <div>Bad: unlike quot; not in HTML 4:</div>
    <div data-val="&apos;"></div>
    <p>
      Besides the quotes, only the ampersand &amp; also has to be escaped, or it would be parsed as an entity otherwise.
    </p>
    <div data-val="&amp;">&amp;</div>
    <p>
      Omitting quotes is OK for values that don't have spaces, but very insane
      <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#attributes-0">http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#attributes-0</a>
      <span style=background-color:red title=title>red</span>.
    </p>

  <h3>#Global attributes</h3>

    <h4>#id</h4>

      <p>
        Before HTML5, id attributes must start with `a-zA-Z`. In particular, no digits.
        This restriction was lifted with HTML5, but it is still recommended to follow it for backwards compatibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        `id` attributes must be unique across the entire document or it is invalid:
        http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/127178/two-html-elements-with-same-id-attribute-how-bad-is-it-really
      </p>

    <h4>#class</h4>

      <p>Multiple classes are space separated as in: <code>"class0 class1 class2"</code></p>

    <h4>#title</h4>

      <p>
        Most user agents shows as a tool tip on hover.
        HTML5 discourages relying on it to show information as it cannot be seen by some user agents,
        notably those without a mouse, like a tablet or cell phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not possible to style the tooltip directly, but there are good CSS ways to reproduce the 
        tooltip effect allowing arbitrary style:
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2011142/how-to-change-the-style-of-title-attribute-inside-the-anchor-tag">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2011142/how-to-change-the-style-of-title-attribute-inside-the-anchor-tag</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#" title="title">a</a></li>
        <li><span title="title">span</span></li>
        <li><span title="title">span</span></li>
      </ul>

    <h4>#hidden</h4>

      <p>HTML5</p>
      <p>Boolean attribute.</p>
      <p>IE11+</p>
      <p>
        Vs CSS <code>display:none</code>:
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6708247/what-is-the-difference-between-the-hidden-attribute-html5-and-the-displaynone">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6708247/what-is-the-difference-between-the-hidden-attribute-html5-and-the-displaynone</a>
        <code>hidden</code> never shows, <code>display:none</code> might show in some devices but not on others.

  <h3>#IDL attribute vs #content attribute</h3>

    <p>
      Not content attributes that are written in HTML tags,
      but rather internal properties that are accessible through Javascript
      properties of the DOM model.
      For this reason they are often called properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Important confusing case: <code>checked</code> attribute vs property.
      Changing the attribute also changes the property, but clicking on the checkbox
      only changes the property, not the attribute.
    </p>

<h2>#categories #flow content #phrasing #which element can contain which</h2>

  <p>HTML5 has many element categories.</p>
  <p>Flow content and phrasing are two of the most important categories.</p>
  <p>Elements can be both flow content and phrasing at the same time.</p>
  <p>One of the most important thing this determines is which elements an element can contain. Each element has:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a list of categories it belongs to</li>
    <li>#Content model: a list of elements or categories it can contain</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Important conclusions that can be taken from content models and categories include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>html can only contain head followed by a body (but omission is possible for head and body)</li>
    <li>head contains metadata category elements: base, link, meta, noscript, script, style, template, title</li>
    <li>body contains flow content</li>
    <li>p is flow content and can only contain phrasing elements, therefore it cannot contain: p, div, ul</li>
    <li>ul can only contain li or script supporting elements</li>
    <li>li contains flow content. It can therefore contain and `p`, `ul`.</li>
    <li>div is and can contain flow content elements</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>#block-level #inline #inline-block #replaced</h3>

    <p>
      HTML4 uses terms block-level, inline and inline-block. In most senses, all elements are either block-level or inline.
    </p>
    <p>HTML5 has many more categories.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>block-level  corresponds roughly to HTML5 flow content
      <li>inline       corresponds roughly to phrasing
    </ul>
    <p>
      Inline replaced elements such as images which behave like elements with CSS `display:inline-block` property.
      They can be put inside other inline elements.
    </p>

<h2>#anchor #link</h2>

  <a href="#href">link to destination</a>
  <p id="href">link destination</p>
  <p>`a` cannot contain `a`.
  <div><div></div></div>
  <a href="html2.html">
    <span>p</span>
    <p>img: <img src="flower.jpg" height="20" width="20" alt=""/></p>
    <!-- The innermost anchor wins the link direction: -->
  </a>
  <p>
    `href` is mandatory. If you don't need it, use a dummy value.
    One common dummy when using the link for Javascript AJAX is:
    <a href="javascript:;">javascript:;</a>.
    What is the best option: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/134845/href-attribute-for-javascript-links-or-javascriptvoid0.
  </p>

  <h3>#nofollow</h3>

    <p>
      Has no special semantics to browsers,
      but may instruct users and search engines not to follow links.
      <a href="html2.html" rel="nofollow">rel="nofollow"</a>
    </p>

  <h3>#target</h3>

    <p>Where to open the link.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#" target="_blank">_bank</a>: new window or tab</li>
      <li><a href="#" target="_self">_self</a>: on current frame. Default.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The other values can only be seen with frames and I'm lazy to do it.</p>

<h2>#img #images</h2>

  <p>img elements are neither inline nor block: they are replaced inline elements.

  <h3>src</h3>

    <p>Must be non empty or invalid HTML5:</p>
    <!--<img src="" alt="empty"/>-->

  <h3>Size</h3>

    <p>It is possible to set width and hight and the browser will resize as requested. height="100" width="200":</p>
    <img src="flower.jpg" height="100" width="300" alt=""/>
    <p>Setting only width or height makes browser keep proportion. `width=300`</p>
    <img src="flower.jpg" width="300" alt=""/>
    <p>
      What is the best way to set image size: CSS (width and height apply to replaced inline elements) or HTML?
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2414506/should-image-size-be-defined-in-the-img-tag-height-width-attributes-or-in-css
    </p>

  <h3>alt</h3>

    <p>If:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>an image does not exist
      <li>the format is not supported by the browser (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_browsers#Image_format_support">support list</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>then alt the browser can show the alt text instead of the image</p>
    <p>
      As of 2013, chrome replaces a missing image with a dummy image, therefore ignoring alt.
      Therefore don't rely on alt being shown in your app logic: alt should only be shown
      in case of error.
      If an image should not present, replace it with something else explicitly.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the HTML5 validator, the <code>alt</code> attribute is mandatory except under certain conditions,
      so just use it always for your sanity.
    </p>
    <!--INVALID:-->
    <!--<img src="i_dont_exist.format_not_supported"/>-->
    <p>With alt text:
    <img src="i_dont_exist.format_not_supported" alt="alt text">

  <h3>legend caption</h3>

    <p>fig + figcaption is good practice in HTML5.</p>
    <p>
      figcaption has no special display,
      It is only semantic and the real work must be done with css.
    </p>
    <p>Browsers may however place it in a sensible place such as the bottom if no style data is found.</p>
    <figure>
      <figcaption>caption 0</figcaption>
      <img src="flower.jpg" height="50" width="50">
    </figure>

  <h3>base64</h3>

    <p>
      Many browsers support base64 inline images http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1207190/embedding-base64-images
      TODO does W3C require them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Obvious tradeoff: one less HTTP request, but harder to reuse image +
      might occupy many screens of code or very long lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reuse might be possible with CSS + background images, but is probably a bad idea:

<h2>#audio</h2>

  <p>Added in HTML5.</p>
  <p>Takes multiple formats, plays the first supported only.</p>
  <p>`controls` attribute adds controls like play / pause:</p>
  <audio controls>
    <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>
  <p>Autoplay (commented out:)</p>
  <!--<audio src="horse.ogg" autoplay></audio>-->
  <p>autoplay loop: great way to annoy users to death! (commented out):</p>
  <!--<audio src="horse.ogg" autoplay loop></audio>-->
  <p>Firefox right click does "Save Audio As" just like it does for images.</p>
  <p>Add some javascript, and you got a music player:</p>
  <audio id="player" src="horse.ogg" controls></audio>
  <div>
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('player').play()">Play</button>
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('player').pause()">Pause</button>
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('player').volume+=0.1">Volume Up</button>
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('player').volume-=0.1">Volume Down</button>
  </div>
  <p>Multiple tracks: just change the src of the auto tag.</p>
  <p>Powerful things can be done with it using the Javascript <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/intro/">Audio API</a>.</p>

<h2>#table</h2>

  <p>Header with th:</p>
  <table>

      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h3>#thead, #tbody and #tfoot</h3>

    <p>thead must come *before* tbody and tfoot in valid HTML, as any sane programmer should do.</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>head 0</th>

<h2>misc phrasing content tags</h2>

  <p>
    In the past, some tags were used to indicate format and not semantics.
    Many were marked obsolete on HTML5 such as `center` in favor of CSS, but some acquired
    semantic meaning related to the context in which they were most often used in, such as `b` for emphasis.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><mark>#mark</mark>: highlight</li>
    <li><dfn>#dfn</dfn>: definition of a term.</li>
    <li><code>#code tag</code>: computer code. The most widely used of this list.</li>
    <li><kbd>#kbd</kbd>: keyboard user input.</li>
    <li><samp>#samp</samp>: sample program output.</li>
    <li><var>#var</var>: computer code variable.</li>
    <li><abbr>#abbr</abbr>: variable.</li>
    <li><ins>#ins</ins>: inserted in document from last version.</li>
    <li><del>#del</del>: removed from document from last version.</li>
    <li><cite>#cite</cite>: name of a work (citation)</li>
    <li><s>#s</s>: strike redefined in HTML5 to the usual meaning of strike: something that was not correct in an older version.
      TODO vs del?
    </li>
    <li>
      <ul>
        <li>strong vs em vs mark: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14741262/when-to-use-strong-em-or-mark</li>
        <li><strong>#strong</strong>: great emphasis without changing meaning of sentence.</li>
        <li><em>#em Emphasis</em>: emphasis, changing meaning of sentence.</li>
        <li><mark>#mark Emphasis</mark>: something that is relevant in another context</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><i>#i: italics</i>. Commonly used unofficially by important libraries such as Bootstrap for Icons.</li>
    <li><b>#b: boldface</b>. Emphasis without change of tone.</li>
    <li><small>#small</small> Makes text small. Quoting HTML5: "Small print typically features disclaimers, caveats, legal restrictions, or copyrights. Small print is also sometimes used for attribution, or for satisfying licensing requirements."</li>
    <li>before<sup>#sup</sup>. Superscript</li>
    <li>before<sub>#sub</sub>. Subscript.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>#obsolete</h2>

  <p>HTML5 rendered some elements and attributes obsolete. This means that:
  <ul>
    <li>pages containing them don't validate
    <li>but browsers should still render them properly for backwards compatibility
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>inline styles: #big #blink #strike #tt #u</li>
    <li>"a name" or "a id" without href</li>
    <li>#acronym</li>
    <li>#applet</li>
    <li>#bgsound</li>
    <li>#center</li>
    <li>#dir</li>
    <li>#fn</li>
    <li>#font</li>
    <li>#frameset #framenoframess</li>
    <li>#isindex</li>
    <li>#layer #ilayer #nolayers</li>
    <li>#listing</li>
    <li>#marquee</li>
    <li>#nobr</li>
    <li>#noembed</li>
    <li>#noscript</li>
    <li>#plaintext</li>
    <li>#spacer</li>
    <li>#xml</li>
    <li>#xmp</li>
  </ul>

<h2>#wbr</h2>

  <p>An extra place where words may break if container too small without adding spaces:</p>
  <p>With in small div:</p>
  <div style="width:20px; border:1px solid black;">aaaaa<wbr/>bbbbbb<wbr/>cccccc</div>
  <p>Without in small div:</p>
  <div style="width:20px; border:1px solid black;">aaaaabbbbbbcccccc</div>
  <p>With in large div:</p>
  <div style="width:500px; border:1px solid black;">aaaaa<wbr/>bbbbbb<wbr/>cccccc</div>

<h2>#bdo</h2>

  <p>Bi Directional override:
    <bdo dir="rtl">
      This text will go right-to-left.
    </bdo>
  </p>

<h2>represent computer #code</h2>

  <p>The Inline element `code` is still often used for computer code representation.</p>
  <p>It does not imply whitespace preservation:</p>
  <p><code>a
b</code></p>
  <p>Common combo with <code>pre</code> to preserve spaces and make it a block element:</p>
  <pre><code>a
b</code></pre>
  <p>My preferred solution: just use <code>code</code> and CSS:</p>
  <code style="white-space:pre; display:block">a
b</code>

  <code style="white-space:pre; display:block">a
b</code>

<h2>#pre</h2>

  <p>White spaces are taken into consideration when rendering.</p>
  <p>Can only contain phrasing content elements like span or b.</p>
  <p>Since it can contain elements, smaller and greater than signs are *not* automatically escaped.</p>
  <p>
    I think that this is a bad tag because it implies style rather than meaning
    and style should be left for CSS, and it can in this case via <code>white-space:pre</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The only difference between `pre` and CSS `white-space:pre` is that `pre` ignores the first character
    if it is a newline, while `white-space:pre` does not.
  </p>
  <div>Newline space:</div>
  <pre class="border">a
 b</pre>

  <div>Newline before and after:</div>
  <pre class="border">
a
 b
  </pre>

  <div>Whitespace newline before and after:</div>
  <pre class="border"> 
a
 b
 </pre>

  <div>Span newline before and after:</div>
  <pre class="border"><span>
a
 b
</span></pre>
  <div>You cannot put HTML4 block-level elements such as `p` inside `pre` (another block level element)</div>

  <div>2 Newlines before and after:</div>
  <pre class="border">

a
 b

  </pre>
  <p>Newline before and after style="white-space:pre"</p>
  <div class="border" style="white-space:pre">
a
 b
  </div>

<h2>#forms</h2>

  <h3>#form</h3>

    <p>
      Contains everything needed to send data to the server,
      including inputs, input labels and a submit button.
    <p>
    <p>Important attributes:<p>
    <ul>
      <li>`action`: where to send the request to
      <li>
        `method`: what HTTP method to use. Can only be:
        <ul>
          <li>get: send data on the URL URL encoded, which has size limitations.
          <li>post: sends data on the body URL encoded.
        </ul>
      <li>
        `enctype`: value of the `content-type` header
        <ul>
          <li>`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`: default. URL encode.
          <li>
            `multipart/form-data`: can only be used if the `method` is `post`.
            Best option for uploading large data such as files via `input type="file"`.
          <li>`text/plain`: useless?
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>To see what forms do exactly, consider using `nc` or an ECHO server.</p>
    <p>Multipart form to http://example.com:</p>
    <form action="http://example.com" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" class="border">
      <p><input type="text" name="text" value="text default"></p>
      <p><input type="file" name="file1"></p>
      <p><input type="file" name="file2"></p>
      <p><button type="submit">Submit</button></p>
    </form>
    <p>
      Sending the form is like clicking a link: the browser attempts to render the reply,
      sets the URL on the address bar, etc. For this reason, the most common action after
      submitting a form is to redirect to somewhere else.
    </p>

  <h3>#name attribute</h3>

    <p>For most form elements, gives the name of the parameter that will be sent on th request.</p>
    <p>If missing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the HTML is still valid</li>
      <li>the value is not submitted</li>
    </ul>
    <form action="#name" class="border" id="name" method="get">
      <input type="text" name="name" value="has name"/>
      <input type="text"             value="no name" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

  <h3>#disabled attribute</h3>

    <p>
      Any form field can have the <code>disabled</code> boolean attribute.
      If present, it:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>prevents the value of the field from being changed</li>
      <li>does not send the disabled field on form submit</li>
      <li>if on submit button, prevents form from being submitted</li>
    </ul>
    <form action="#disabled" class="border" id="disabled" method="get">
      <input type="text" name="name0" value="enabled"/>
      <input type="text" name="name1" value="disabled" disabled="disabled"/>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      <button type="submit" disabled="disabled">Submit Disabled</button>
    </form>

    <p>The disabled IDL attribute (Javascript property) always matches the content attribute.</p>
    <p>Even so, it is better to modify the IDL attribute instead of the content attribute,
      making things more uniform with <code>checkbox</code> operation, and avoiding unnecessary HTML modification.
    </p>
    <p>
      <button onclick="document.getElementById('disabled-toggle').removeAttribute('disabled')">
        Remove disabled
      </button>
      <button onclick="document.getElementById('disabled-toggle').setAttribute('disabled', 'disabled')">
        Add disabled
      </button>
      <input id="disabled-toggle" type="checkbox" disabled="disabled"/>
    </p>

    <h4>#boolean attribute</h4>

      <p>
        Examples: <code>disabled</code>, checkbox's <code>checked</code>,
        <code>select</code>'s <code>selected</code>.
      </p>
      <p>If not present: false. If present, true.</p>
      <p>Do not need a value, but if a value is given there are only two valid possibilities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>empty string</li>
        <li>equal to the attribute case insensitive</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The best option is using an exact lowercase match of the attribute,
        which is also XHTML5 portable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mostly historical elements: new elements like <code>contenteditable</code>
        get the saner <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> valid values.
      </p>

  <h3>#readonly attribute</h3>

    <p>Boolean attribute.</p>
    <p>
      If true, field cannot be modified, but unlike disabled will be sent with the form
      and its text can be selected.
    </p>
    <form action="#readonly" class="border" id="readonly" method="get">
      <input type="text" name="name0" value="normal"/>
      <input type="text" name="name1" value="readonly" readonly="readonly"/>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
    <p>
      Invalid for checkboxes:
      <!--<input type="checkbox" readonly>-->
      <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/155291/can-html-checkboxes-be-set-to-readonly">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/155291/can-html-checkboxes-be-set-to-readonly</a>
      Just disable them.
    </p>

  <h3>#button</h3>

    <p>`type`: should always be specified to avoid browser inconsistencies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>button:	nothing special about it. Mostly used with Javascript</li>
      <li>submit: do the enclosing form's `action`.</li>
      <li>reset:  reset data of enclosing form to default values.</li>
    </ul>
    <form action="#button-type" id="button-type">
      <input  type="text" name="a" value="0"/>
      <button type="submit">submit</button>
      <button type="reset">reset</button>
      <button type="button">button</button>
    </form>

  <h3>#label</h3>

    <p>The visible name of the form field.</p>
    <p>
      Does not have lead to many programmatic effects, except that clicking on the label
      may focus or toggle its corresponding form control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most flexible way to use labels is with the <code>for</code>
      attribute pointing to the input id:
    </p>
    <p class="border">
      <input type="checkbox" id="label-target" style="margin-right:20px;"/>
      <label for="label-target">External label, click me!</label>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also possible to put the input inside the label.
      This allows not to give IDs to inputs and to click on the space between the checkbox and the label,
      but is harder to style and less logical.

    </p>
    <p class="border">
      <label>
        <input type="checkbox" style="margin-right:20px;"/>
        Surrounding label, click me!
      </label>
    </p>

  <h3>#input</h3>

    <p>It is valid HTLM5 to omit the type attribute, but a bad practice due to browser inconsistencies.</p>

    <h4>#text</h4>

      <p>value="default": initial content in the text field: <input type="text" value="default"/></p>
      <p>size="3" <input type="text" size="3"/></p>
      <p>size="5" <input type="text" size="5"/></p>
      <p>placeholder="asdf": text that shows when the field is empty: <input type="text" size="5" placeholder="asdf"/></p>
      <p>placeholder="asdf", value="default" <input type="text" size="5" placeholder="asdf" value="default"/></p>

    <h4>#checkbox</h4>

      <p>The value sent is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>if checked: the <code>name=value</code> pair</li>
        <li>otherwise: nothing is sent</li>
      </ul>
      <form action="#checkbox" id="checkbox" method="get">
        <label>
          <input name="name" type="checkbox" value="1" />
          label
        </label>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>

      <h5>#checked</h5>

        <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#attr-input-checked">http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#attr-input-checked</a></p>
        <p>Boolean attribute that determines the checkbox's initial checked state.</p>
        <p>
          If modified, also modifies the checked state if the checkbox hasn't been clicked on.
          It it has, a dirty flag is set, and adding or removing the attribute does not modify the checked state.
        </p>
        <p>Resetting a form resets the dirty flag.</p>
        <p>
          The conclusion is simple: only use this attribute to set the initial value of the checkbox:
          never modify it with Javascript. Use the <code>checked</code> property instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contrast this complex behavior with that of the <code>disabled</code> attribute,
          which always matches the IDL attribute.
        </p>
        <form action="#checked" id="checked" method="get">
          <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('checked-toggle').removeAttribute('checked')">
            Remove checked
          </button>
          <button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('checked-toggle').setAttribute('checked', 'checked')">
            Add checked
          </button>
          <input id="checked-toggle" type="checkbox" checked="checked"/>
          <button type="reset">Reset</button>
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
        <p>
          <b>Beware!</b> Some browsers like Firefox might remember the checkbox value from old submits,
          and override this attribute. Your logic should not depend on it's initial state.

    <h4>#radio</h4>

      <p>
        A good way to give a title for all the buttons is through a
        <code>fieldset</code> + <code>legend</code> pair.
      </p>
      <form action="#radio" class="border" id="radio" method="get">
        <fieldset>
          <legend>Name</legend>
          <div><label><input type="radio" name="name" value="a"> a</label></div>
          <div><label><input type="radio" name="name" value="b" checked="checked"> b</label></div>
          <div><label><input type="radio" name="name" value="c"> c</label></div>
        </fieldset>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>

    <h4>#image type</h4>

      <p>Shows image, user clicks, submits form and sends click coordinates as <code>name.x=1&amp;name.y=2</code></p>
      <form action="#image-type" id="image-type" method="get">

    <p><textarea>default</textarea></p>
    <p><textarea rows="3" cols="5">rows=3 cols=5</textarea></p>

  <h3>#file</h3>

    <p>
      Opens a file selector popup.
      Should almost always be used with <code>form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data"</code>.
      Accepts the <code>multiple</code> attribute.
    </p>
    <form action="#file" id="file" method="get">
      <input type="file" name="file"/>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

    <h4>#multiple attribute</h4>

      <p>Currently only valid for file and email.</p>
      <p>
        Multiple files, control select multiple files in the popup and submits.
        Data is sent as: <code>file=path1&amp;file=path2</code>.
      </p>
      <form action="#file-multiple" id="file-multiple" method="get">
        <input type="file" name="file" multiple="multiple"/>

  <h3>#select #option #dropdown select</h3>

    <p>
      The boolean attribute <code>selected</code> marks the default.
      Dirtiness analogous to checkbox's <code>checked</code>.
    </p>
    <form action="#select" id="select">
      <select name="select-name">
        <option value="a">a text</option>

      </select>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>

    </form>
    <p>TODO how to get the private key?</p>

  <h3>#fieldset</h3>

    <p>HTML5</p>
    <p>Groups several form elements.</p>
    <p>If disabled, all its elements are disabled.</p>
    <p>TODO any more behavior changes? What is the name attribute for?</p>

      </fieldset>
    </form>

  <h3>#validation without Javascript</h3>

    <p>HTML5 adds great form validation abilities through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>extra input types like <code>email</code></li>
      <li>attributes like <code>required</code>, <code>min</code> and <code>pattern</code></li>
      <li>
        pseudo classes like <code>:invalid</code> and <code>:required</code>
        which can be used from CSS without Javascript
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Invalid forms fields also raise the <code>oninvalid</code> event if you need some Javascript.</p>
    <p>Browsers like Firefox show invalid fields with red default CSS.</p>
    <p>
      On submit, browsers can open a speech balloon with an error message over invalid fields.
      It does not seem possible to customize the message without Javascript:
      <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5272433/html5-form-required-attribute-set-custom-validation-message">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5272433/html5-form-required-attribute-set-custom-validation-message</a>
    </p>

    <h4>#required attribute</h4>

      <p>Try to submit with an empty field:</p>
      <form action="#required" id="required" method="get">
        <input type="text" name="name0" value="" required="required"/>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>

    <h4>#pattern attribute</h4>

      <p>Field must match a Javascript regexp to be valid.</p>
      <form action="#pattern" id="pattern" method="get">
        <input type="text" value="letters only or spaces only 012" pattern="[ a-zA-Z]*"/>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>

    <h4>#number type #min #max</h4>

      <p>Between 10 and 20:</p>
      <form action="#number" id="number" method="get">
        <input type="number" value="15" min="10" max="20"/>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>

    <h4>#email</h4>

      <p>
        Matches a huge regexp that represents valid emails
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#valid-e-mail-address">http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#valid-e-mail-address</a>
      </p>
      <form action="#email" id="email" method="get">
        <input type="email" value="a@b.c"/>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>

    <h4>#url</h4>

      <p>
        TODO what validation is done? HTML5 links to the URL standard:
        <a href="http://url.spec.whatwg.org/">http://url.spec.whatwg.org/</a>
      </p>

    <h4>#time</h4>

      <p>There are several time validators: month, week, etc.</p>

  <h3>#spellcheck attribute</h3>

    <p>Determines if the browser will spellcheck and highlight errors or not.</p>
    <p>Works for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>textarea</li>
      <li>input</li>
      <li>contenteditable elements</li>
    </ul>
    <textarea spellcheck="true" >spellcheck=true  right wrongg</textarea>
    <textarea spellcheck="false">spellcheck=false right wrongg</textarea>

  <h3>#contenteditable attribute</h3>

    <p>
      If true, you can edit the content of the element like for a textarea.
      Tab cycles through such elements.
    </p>
    <p class="border" contenteditable="true">p contenteditable=true</p>
    <p class="border" contenteditable="false">p contenteditable=false</p>

  <h3>#autocomplete attribute</h3>

    <p>HTML5</p>
    <p>Determines if browser should suggest auto complete values based on previous form submits.</p>
    <p>Consider the <code>datalist</code> element if you have a predetermined suggestion list for the user.</p>
    <p>Default <code>on</code>.</p>
    <p>TODO: what do browsers use exactly for the prediction? URL + <code>name</code> attribute?</p>

  <h3>#datalist #list</h3>

    <p>
      Suggest autocomplete data from fixed data set to text field.
      Shows possibilities that match what user it typing.
    </p>
    <p>Also shows autocomplete values if enabled.</p>
    <p>Options: "abcdef", "defghi", "ghijkl".</p>
    <form action="#datalist" id="datalist">
      <input list="datalist-id" name="name">
      <datalist id="datalist-id">
        <option value="abcdef">
        <option value="defghi">
        <option value="ghijkl">
      </datalist>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>

<h2>#meter</h2>

  <p>HTML5</p>
  <p>A visual percentage measure.</p>
  <p>
    value="0.6"                        : <meter value="0.6"                        >60%        </meter><br/>
    value="2"   min="0" max="10"       : <meter value="2"   min="0" max="10"       >2 out of 10</meter><br/>
    value="2"   min="0" max="10" low=3 : <meter value="2"   min="0" max="10" low=3 >2 out of 10</meter><br/>
    value="2"   min="0" max="10" high=1: <meter value="2"   min="0" max="10" high=1>2 out of 10</meter><br/>
  </p>

<h2>#progress</h2>

  <p>Indicates progress of a process. Meant to be modified with Javascript.</p>
  <p>How is it different from meter? HTML5 says: only to measure time.</p>
  <p>22 out of 100: <progress value="22" max="100"></progress></p>

<h2>#ruby #rp #rt</h2>

  <p>HTML5</p>
  <p>
    Main purpose: give phonetic reading for languages like Chinese,
    which are very hard to learn to read because they have weak correspondence between text and sound.
    Used  mostly in texts targeting students, teenagers or foreign learners.
  </p>
  <p>Low support as of 2014.</p>
  <p>
    Chinese pinyin:
    <ruby>
      河<rt>hé</rt>
      蟹<rt>xiè</rt>
    </ruby>
  </p>
  <p>
    Nested: Japanese + Japanese phonetic symbols + Japanese romanisation:
    <ruby><ruby>攻<rp>（</rp><rt>こう</rt><rp>）</rp>殻<rp>（</rp><rt>かく</rt><rp>
    </rp>機<rp>（</rp><rt>き</rt><rp>）</rp>動<rp>（</rp><rt>どう</rt><rp>）</rp>隊<rp>
    （</rp><rt>たい</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby><rp>（</rp><rt>Kōkakukidōtai</rt><rp>）</rp></ruby>
  </p>
  <p>I bet this will be used by the Ruby programming language community at some point.</p>

<h2>#time</h2>

  <p>HTML5.</p>
  <p>Semantic for times.</p>
  <p>Does not render as anything special in major browsers.</p>
  <p>Can have the <code>datetime</code> attribute to specify time for inner content.</p>
  <p>No attribute: <time>10:00</time></p>
  <p><code>datetime</code> attribute <time datetime="2008-02-14">Valentine's day</time>.</p> 

<h2>#MathML #math element</h2>

  <p>Standard way to represent mathematics.</p>
  <p>Uses an XML like language not suitable for direct user input, not LaTeX.</p>
  <p>A converter from LaTeX to MathML such as Blahtexml or itex2MML or is inescapable content writers.</p>
  <p>TODO examples</p>

<h2>#noscript</h2>

  <p>Browser may show if Javascript is not supported.</p>
  <p>Block element.</p>
  <script>document.write("<div>javascript</div>")</script>
  <noscript>No Javascript.</noscript>

<h2>#frame #iframe</h2>

  <p>Include another HTML document in the current one.</p>
  <p>
    This element therefore automatically makes an HTTP request to another page,
    so it is an interesting way go include HTML content without any Javascript.
  </p>
  <p>In the past, before server side scripting, widely used to reuse code fragments such as indexes.
  <p>Now generally frowned upon for navigation.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>`frame` was invalidated in HTML5.</li>
    <li>`iframe`, inline frame, is still valid in HTML5.</li>
  </ul>
  <iframe src="iframe.html">iframe failed to load</iframe>
  <p>iframe always has a fixed size, which you can change with CSS:</p>
  <iframe src="iframe.html" style="width:600px; height:50px;">iframe failed to load</iframe>
  <p>
    Disable scroll in HTML5 CSS3 is not yet widely supported:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1691873/safari-chrome-webkit-cannot-hide-iframe-vertical-scrollbar
  </p>
  <p>
    The frame content is like `alt` for images.
    Your browser may simply ignore it in case of failure if he has something better to do
    (Firefox 27 shows the not found page with a reload button.)
  </p>
  <div><iframe src="i-do-no-exist.html">i-do-not-exist.html failed to load</iframe></div>
</body>
